NeuroFleetX is a next-generation platform designed to revolutionize urban mobility and fleet management. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), real-time geospatial data, and a microservices architecture, it offers a proactive solution to the challenges of traffic congestion, operational inefficiency, and sustainability in smart cities. The platform provides a unified, intelligent ecosystem for fleet operators, rental companies, and urban planners.
Here is a detailed specification for the NeuroFleetX project, broken down into functional and non-functional requirements.

1. Functional Requirements
User Management & Access Control

FR-1.1: The system must allow users to register, log in, and log out securely.

FR-1.2: The system must support at least three distinct user roles: Admin, Fleet Manager, and Driver.

FR-1.3: The system must enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific APIs and UI components based on the user's role.

Vehicle & Fleet Management

FR-2.1: The system must provide an API and UI for an Admin to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on vehicle data.

FR-2.2: The system must display a list of all vehicles to any authenticated user.

FR-2.3: The system must display a real-time map showing the current location of all active vehicles.

FR-2.4: The system must simulate a real-time stream of vehicle location data for testing and demonstration purposes.

AI-Driven Optimization (Planned)

FR-3.1: The system must have a dedicated Python microservice for AI/ML logic.

FR-3.2: The AI microservice must implement a predictive maintenance model to forecast potential vehicle failures based on simulated IoT sensor data.

FR-3.3: The AI microservice must implement a dynamic route optimization model that provides real-time route recommendations based on traffic, weather, and road closure data.

Dashboard & Visualization

FR-4.1: The system must provide a dedicated dashboard for Fleet Managers and Admins.

FR-4.2: The dashboard must display key performance indicators (KPIs) such as vehicle utilization, total trips, and fuel efficiency in a visual format (charts, graphs).

Notifications

FR-5.1: The system must send real-time alerts to users for critical events (e.g., maintenance flags, route deviation). This can be done via push notifications or email.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: The real-time tracking system must have a latency of less than 2 seconds between a simulated location update and its display on the map.

Scalability: The system's microservices architecture must allow for independent scaling of the Node.js backend and the Python AI microservice.

Security: All API endpoints must be secured using JWT-based authentication. User passwords must be stored securely using hashing.

Usability: The frontend must be intuitive, responsive, and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

Test Cases
Here are some example test cases to validate the functionality of the NeuroFleetX platform. This is a mix of functional, integration, and user-flow tests.

1. Authentication & Authorization Tests
Test Case ID: AU-01

Test Case Name: Admin Login and RBAC

Test Steps:

Log in as a user with the 'admin' role.

Navigate to the 'Vehicle Management' page.

Verify that 'Add', 'Update', and 'Delete' buttons are visible.

Log out.

Log in as a user with the default 'user' role.

Navigate to the 'Vehicle Management' page.

Verify that 'Add', 'Update', and 'Delete' buttons are not visible.

Expected Result: The 'admin' user can see and access all CRUD features, while the 'user' cannot.

2. Real-Time Tracking Tests
Test Case ID: RT-01

Test Case Name: Live Vehicle Location Update

Test Steps:

Log in as any authenticated user.

Navigate to the main dashboard with the map.

Observe a vehicle's icon on the map.

Simulate a location update for that vehicle from the backend (e.g., via a manual trigger or script).

Verify that the vehicle's icon on the frontend map moves to the new location within 2 seconds.

Expected Result: The vehicle's icon moves smoothly on the map in near real-time, reflecting the backend update.

3. API & Data Integrity Tests
Test Case ID: API-01

Test Case Name: Vehicle Creation by Admin

Test Steps:

Send a POST request to the /api/vehicles endpoint with valid vehicle data while authenticated as an Admin.

Verify the response status code is 201 Created.

Send a GET request to the /api/vehicles endpoint.

Verify that the newly created vehicle is present in the response payload.

Expected Result: A new vehicle is successfully created in the database and is visible via the API.

4. Planned Feature (AI) Tests
Test Case ID: AI-01

Test Case Name: Predictive Maintenance Alert Trigger

Test Steps:

Start the Python AI microservice.

Send simulated sensor data to the microservice that meets the criteria for a high-risk maintenance flag (e.g., extremely low tire pressure).

Verify that the microservice's API returns a maintenance alert.

Verify that the Node.js backend receives this alert and sends a notification to the Fleet Manager's email (or a console log in the test environment).

Expected Result: The AI model correctly identifies a maintenance risk and triggers an alert through the notification system.
